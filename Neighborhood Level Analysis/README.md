# Neighborhood level analysis
This folder contains all codes/results required to generate neighborhood level analysis results. We analyzed the travel patterns of two neighborhoods in Seattle, including West Seattle (west) and Queen Anne (queen). 

## Highlights
- Trip rates
- Commute trip travel times
- Commute trip departure times
- Person miles travelled


## Potential usage
The code provided here can be used to compute the related travel metrics and generate plots for neighborhood level trip rates, commute trip travel times, commute trip departure times, and person miles travelled.
- neighborhood.R is used to generate metrics from trip end results.
- Figure.py is used to plot corresponding figures.
